I.    Requirements
==================================================
The CGViewer is written in C++ and uses OpenGL and
Qt. It also needs the GLEW-library.


II.   Compiling CGViewer
==================================================
First run 'qmake' then 'make'. The 'qmake' is only
required if the CGViewer.pro file is changed.


III.  Start CGViewer
==================================================
Start the compiled file, CGViewer.

V.    Tasks
==================================================
In the module "Computergrafik" I recently joined,
I have to write a raytracer. We had given a simple
user interface, in which you can load models, to
create a scene, save this scene. The task is to
write the raytracing function.

The first task is to write the intersection and
give every triangle a specific color. Then to
optimize the intersection by dividing the image
into parts an add the triangle to these parts.

The second task is to implement the Phong
reflection model and also texturing.

The third task is to implement reflection and
refraction.

The fourth task is to implement the Phong
reflection model with GLSL (shader programming).

The fifth task is to implement normal mapping and
Toon shader with GLSL.
